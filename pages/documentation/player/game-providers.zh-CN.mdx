You have to wrap the `Player` component with the `GameProviders` component. 

## Usage

import { GameProviders } from "narraleaf-react";
```

Wrap the `Player` component with the `GameProviders` component.

```tsx
<GameProviders>
    <Player ... />
</GameProviders>
```

### Using defined game instance

```tsx
"use client";

import { Game, GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Page() {
    // pass your game config here
    const [game] = useState(new Game({}));

    return (
        <GameProviders game={game}>
            <Player ... />
        </GameProviders>
    );
}
```
