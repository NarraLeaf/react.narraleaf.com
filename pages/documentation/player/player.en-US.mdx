# Player

Player component is used to play the story. 

> Note: You have to wrap the `Player` component with the [GameProviders](./game-providers) component to provide the game instance.

If you are creating a story using abstract classes, please check the [Core](/documentation/core) documentation.

## Example

This is a basic example of how to use the `Player` component:

```tsx
"use client";

import { GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
import { story } from "./my-story";

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <GameProviders>
            <Player story={story} onReady={({ liveGame }) => {
                liveGame.newGame();
            }}
                width="100vw"
                height="100vh"
            />
        </GameProviders>
    );
}
```
