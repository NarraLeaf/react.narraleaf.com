Position utils help you to fix the position of the components in the player and scale them according to the screen size.

## Usage

Import the components from the NarraLeaf-React library.

```tsx
import { Top, Center, Bottom } from "narraleaf-react";
```

And use them in your components.

```tsx
<Player ...>
    <Top.Left>
        <You-Quick-Menu />
    </Top.Left>
    <Bottom.Right>
        <...>
    </Bottom.Right>
</Player>
```

The quick menu will fix to the top left of the player and will scale along with the player.

Below is an example of where these positions are fixed.
