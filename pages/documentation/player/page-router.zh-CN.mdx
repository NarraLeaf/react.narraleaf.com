# Page Router

In NarraLeaf-React 0.3.0, we introduced the new way to customize the user interface of the player.  
Your UI content is now abstracted into pages, and you can navigate between them using the Page Router API.

Elements in a page will be scaled to fit the player's size.

## Example

```tsx
import { Page, Player, useRouter } from "narraleaf-react";
```

```tsx
function GameApp() {
    // Get the router instance
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
        <Player
            router={router}
        >
            {/* Your pages */}
            <Page id="about" className="...">
                <span>about</span>
            </Page>

            <Page id="contact" className="...">
                <span>contact</span>
            </Page>
        </Player>
    );
}
```

## Page Router API

### useRouter

In Page Router API, a router instance is used to navigate between pages.  
You can get the router instance by using the `useRouter` hook.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "narraleaf-react";
```

```tsx
const router = useRouter();

// you can navigate to a page by using the `router` instance
useEffect(() => {
    router.push("about");
    router.back();
    router.forward();
    router.cleanHistory();
}, []);

// and access the current page id
console.log(router.getCurrentId());
```

After getting the router instance, you need to pass it to the `Player` component.

```tsx
<Player
    router={router}
>
    {/* Your pages */}
</Player>
```

For more information, please check [Router](./page-router/router) and [useRouter](./hooks/useRouter).

### Page

Page is used to define the content of a page.

```tsx
import { Page } from "narraleaf-react";
```

```tsx
<Page id="about" className="...">
    <span>about</span>
    <p>...</p>
</Page>
```
