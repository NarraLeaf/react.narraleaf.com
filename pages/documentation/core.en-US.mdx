# NarraLeaf-React Core

Core is the main functionality of NarraLeaf-React. It provides the basic building blocks for creating a Visual Novel with React.

If you have not read the [Quick Start](/documentation/quick-start) yet, we recommend you to read it first. It will help you understand the basic concepts of NarraLeaf-React.

If you are looking for some components such as `Player`, `GameProviders`, or `Top`, you can find them in the [Player](/documentation/player) section.

## Core

Core is the main functionality of NarraLeaf-React. You can use its abstract classes to create a story.
It has three parts:

[Elements](./core/elements) are the basic building blocks of NarraLeaf-React. They are used to create actions in the story.  
[Animation](./core/animation) is used to create complex animations for the elements.  
[Game](./core/game) is the main class that represents the game's current state. For example, you can use [LiveGame](./core/game/live-game) to save and load the game.

## Create Story

Story is the bigggest concept in NarraLeaf-React. You can define a story in a typescript file and export it. 

```ts
import {Story,Scene} from "narraleaf-react";

const story = new Story("My First NarraLeaf Story"); // a human-readable name
```

After that, you can add an entry point to the story. 

```ts
const scene1 = new Scene("scene1", {});

story.entry(scene1);
```

Finally, you can export the story and use it in your React app.

```tsx
"use client";

import { GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
import { story } from "./scene1"; // your story

export default function App() {
    return (
        <GameProviders>

            <Player 
                story={story} // your story
            />

        </GameProviders>
    );
}
```

## Add Actions

To show something on the screen, you need to add actions to the story. 

The basic action container is `Scene`. You can create a scene like this:

```ts
const scene1 = new Scene("Scene 1");
```

And then, you can add actions to the scene. 

```ts
const character1 = new Character("Character 1");

scene1.action([
    character1
        .say("Hello World!")
        .say("Good morning!"),
]);
```

Your story will execute the actions in order. It will show the dialog "Hello World!" and "Good morning!" on the screen.

Read more about `Element` in the [Elements](/documentation/core/elements) section.

## Example

Here is an example of a complete story.

<Tabs items={['src/story.ts', 'src/page.tsx']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```ts
        import {
            Story,
            Scene,
            Character,
        } from "narraleaf-react";

        // Create a story
        const story = new Story("My Story");
        const scene1 = new Scene("Scene 1", {
            background: {
                url: "https://via.placeholder.com/1920x1080"
            },
        });

        // define your characters
        const character1 = new Character("Character 1");
        const character2 = new Character("Character 2");

        // add actions to the scene
        scene1.action([
            character1
                .say("Hello World!")
                .say("Welcome to NarraLeaf!")
                .say("This is a Visual Novel framework for React.")
                .say("I hope you enjoy it!"),

            character2
                .say("Start your story by editing this file.")
                .say("We have a lot of features for you."),
        ]);

        // add the scene to the story
        story.entry(scene1);

        export { story };
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```tsx
        "use client";

        import { Game, GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
        import { useState } from "react";
        import { story } from "./story";

        export default function App() {
            return (
                <GameProviders game={game}>
                    <Player 
                        // pass the story to the Player component
                        story={story} 
                        onReady={({game}) => {
                            // start the game when the Player is ready
                            game.getLiveGame().newGame();
                        }} 
                        height={"100vh"} 
                    />
                </GameProviders>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
