# Quick Start

NarraLeaf-React is easy to understand and use. This guide will help you create your first Visual Novel with NarraLeaf-React.

## Create Your First Visual Novel

Now it's time to create your first Visual Novel with NarraLeaf-React.

<Steps>

### Create a new React app

First, create a new React app using Create React App.

navigate to the directory where you want to create your app and run the following command:

<Tabs items={['npx', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        npx create-react-app my-first-narraleaf-app --template my-first-narraleaf-app
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        npm init react-app my-first-narraleaf-app --template my-first-narraleaf-app
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        yarn create react-app my-first-narraleaf-app --template my-first-narraleaf-app
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

This will create a new React app with NarraLeaf-React template.

### Run the app

To preview the app, run the app using the following command:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        yarn start
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash
        pnpm start
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

You can visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your first Visual Novel.

</Steps>

Congratulations! You have created your first Visual Novel with NarraLeaf-React.

You can edit the `src/story.ts` file to create your own story! 

## Core Concepts

Before we start, let's understand some core concepts of NarraLeaf-React.

NarraLeaf is based on the concept of **Scenes**, **Elements**, and **Actions**.  

### Scene

A **Scene** is a collection of **Actions** that are executed in order. You can use a **Scene** to create a conversation, a choice, or a cutscene.  

For example, you can use a **Scene** to represent a conversation organized by background, time, or process.  

A basic story may contain these **Scenes**:
1. `scene-1-wake-up`: The protagonist wakes up in the morning.
2. `scene-2-go-to-school`: The protagonist goes to school.
3. `scene-3-meet-friend`: The protagonist meets a friend.

A scene using multiple background is also possible. 

### Element

An **Element** is a basic unit of a story. It can be a character, an image, or a sound. 

For example, you can use `Character` to represent a character in the story. It can shows a dialog.   
Also, you can use `Image` to represent an image in the story. It can shows charaters.  
> **Note**: Character only shows dialog, and Image only shows image. They are separated. 

Here is a tree that shows the relationship: 

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Story" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Scene" />
        <FileTree.Folder name="Character" defaultOpen>
            <FileTree.File name="Sentence" />
            <FileTree.File name="Word" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.File name="Image" />
        <FileTree.File name="Sound" />
        <FileTree.File name="Menu" />
        <FileTree.File name="Script" />
        <FileTree.File name="Condition" />
        <FileTree.File name="Control" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Animation" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Transform" />
        <FileTree.File name="Transition" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

As you can see, here are some basic elements in NarraLeaf-React.  
We will use these elements to create a story in the next section.

### Action

**Action** is the most important concept in NarraLeaf-React. 

Every method you call on the elements is an **Action**. Action can do something, like show a dialog, play a sound, or change the background. 
NarraLeaf-React can only understand **Actions**. 

For example, you can use `character.say` to show a dialog.

```typescript
import {Character} from "narraleaf-react";

const character1 = new Character("John Smith");
character1.say("Hello, World!"); // This is an action
```

Some elements can receive actions, ex. `Scene`  
Scene will execute actions in order. 

```typescript
import {Scene, Character} from "narraleaf-react";

const scene1 = new Scene("scene-1-wake-up");
const character1 = new Character("John Smith");
const character2 = new Character("Alice");

scene1.action([
    character1
        .say("Hello, World!")
        .say("Good morning!"),
    character2
        .say("Hi, John!")
        .say("How are you?")
]);
```

Finally, you can use a story to wrap the scenes. 

```typescript
import {Story} from "narraleaf-react";

/*
...your scenes
*/

const story = new Story();
story.entry(scene1);

export default story;
```

When you placing the Player component in your React app, you can import the story and pass it to the Player component. We will talk about this later. 

In conclusion, NarraLeaf-React is based on the concept of `Scene`, `Element`, and `Action`.
**Scenes contain actions, and actions are generated by elements.**
