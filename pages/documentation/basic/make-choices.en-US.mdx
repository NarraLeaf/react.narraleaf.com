# Make Choices

You can crerate a menu with choices by using the [Menu](../core/elements/menu) element.

```typescript
const narrator = new Character(null);

/**
 * What should I do?
 * - Go left
 *    ~> *You went left.*
 *    ~> jump to scene "scene_went_left"
 * 
 * - Go right
 *    ~> *You went right.*
 *    ~> jump to scene "scene_went_right"
 */

scene.action([
    Menu.prompt("What should I do?")

        .choose("Go left", [
            narrator`You went left.`,
            /* ... */
            scene.jumpTo(scene_went_left),
        ])

        .choose("Go right", [
            narrator`You went right.`,
            /* ... */
            scene.jumpTo(scene_went_right),
        ]);
]);
```

You can show the menu prompt with a custom [Sentence](../core/elements/sentence).

```typescript
import { i, b } from "narraleaf-react";
// Show the menu prompt with a custom sentence
Menu.prompt(
    i("What should I do?")  // "What should I do?" with italic style
).choose([
    "Go ", b("left") // "Go left" with "left" in bold style
]), [
    /* ... */
])
```
