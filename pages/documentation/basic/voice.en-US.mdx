# Voice

You can add a voice to a sentence by using the `voice` config:

```typescript
new Sentence("hello", {
    voice: "https://YOUR_VOICE_URL.mp3",
});
```

Or use an existing sound instance:

```typescript
import {SoundType} from "narraleaf-react";

const voice = new Sound({
    src: "https://YOUR_VOICE_URL.mp3",
    type: SoundType.voice,
});

new Sentence("hello", {
    voice,
});
```
