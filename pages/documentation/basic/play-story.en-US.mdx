# Play Story

After creating a abstract story, you can play it using react components. 

```tsx
"use client";

import { GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
import { story } from "./my-story"; // Import your story here

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <GameProviders>
            <Player story={story} onReady={({ liveGame }) => {
                liveGame.newGame(); // when the player is ready, start the game
            }}
                width="100%" // full width
                height="100%" // full height
            />
        </GameProviders>
    );
}
```

The [GameProviders](../player/game-providers) component is required to play the story. It provides the context for the player and hooks to work.
You can use hooks inside the GameProviders component to interact with the game instance.
