# Show Dialog

To show a dialog, you can use a [Character](../core/elements/character) element. 

```typescript
import { Scene, Character } from "narraleaf-react";

// Create a scene
const scene1 = new Scene("scene 1 - wake up", {
    // ...
});

// Create a character
const character1 = new Character("John Smith");

// Add actions to the scene
scene1.action([
    character1
        .say`Hello, World!`
        .say`Good morning!`,
]);
```

The character with the name "John Smith" will say "Hello, World!" and "Good morning!".

You can add some customization to the dialog by using the [Word](../core/elements/word) and the [Sentence](../core/elements/sentence) element.

```typescript
character1.say`Hello, my name is ${Word.bold("John")}!`; // will output "Hello, my name is John!" with "John" in bold
```

You can also construct a complex dialog using these elements.

```typescript
character1.say(new Sentence([
    `You have `,
    new Word(
        (ctx) => ctx.storable.getNamespace("game").get("coin"),
        { color: "red" }
    ),
    ` coins`
    // "you have <player coin> coins" with the coin number in red
]));
```

For more information about constructing a sentence, you can read the [Sentence](../core/elements/sentence) documentation.

In this example, the character will say "Hello, my name is John" with the word "John" in red.

You can read more about the [Character](../core/elements/character) element in the documentation.
