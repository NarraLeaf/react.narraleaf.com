# Show Image

To show an image, you need to use the [Image](../core/elements/image) element.

## Define an Image

You can construct an image by providing the [ImageConfig](../core/types/ImageConfig) object.

```typescript
import {Image} from "narraleaf-react";

const character1Happy = new Image("character1_happy", {
    src: "https://YOUR_IMAGE_URL",
    scale: 0.5,
    position: {
        yalign: 0.3,
        xalign: 0.5,
    },
});
```

This image will be displayed at the left side of the screen with a scale of 0.5.

## Show the Image

You can show the image by adding actions to the scene.

```typescript
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.show(),
]);
```

The image will be displayed on the screen immediately.

You can show the image with ease. 

```typescript
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.show({
        ease: "easeInOut",
        duration: 1000,
    }),
]);
```

## Hide the Image

You can hide the image by adding actions to the scene.

```typescript
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.hide(),
]);
```

The image will be hidden from the screen immediately.

You can hide the image with ease. 

```typescript
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.hide({
        ease: "easeInOut",
        duration: 1000,
    }),
]);
```

## Change the Image

You can change the image by updating the image source.

```typescript
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.setSrc("https://NEW_IMAGE_URL"),
]);
```

or with a [transition](../core/animation/transition).

```typescript
import {Fade} from "narraleaf-react";

scene1.action([
    character1Happy.setSrc("https://NEW_IMAGE_URL", new Fade(300)),
]);
```

## Animate the Image

You can animate the image with [Transform](../core/animation/transform).

```typescript
import {Transform, CommonPosition} from "narraleaf-react";

// Move the image to the right side of the screen
scene1.action([
    character1Happy.applyTransform(new Transform<TransformDefinitions.ImageTransformProps>([
        {
            props: {
                position: CommonPosition.Positions.Right,
            },
            options: {
                duration: 120,
                ease: "easeOut",
            }
        }
    ])),
]);
```

The image will move to the right side of the screen with a duration of 120 milliseconds and ease out effect.
