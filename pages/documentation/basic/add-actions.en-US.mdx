# Add Actions

Actions are the most important part of a scene. They are the things that make the story interactive.

You can simply add actions to the scene:

```typescript
const scene1 = new Scene("scene 1 - wake up", {
    // ...
});
const scene2 = new Scene("scene 2 - breakfast", {
    // ...
});

scene1.action([
    // ...
    scene1.jump(scene2),
]);
```

The `action` method accepts an array of actions. You can use [elements](../core/elements) to create actions.

`scene1.jump` will create a jump action. It will jump to the next scene when the action is executed.

> Note: actions after the jump action will not be executed.
