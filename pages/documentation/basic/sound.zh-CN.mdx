# Sound

In NarraLeaf-React, you can play sounds by using the [Sound](../core/elements/sound) element.

```typescript
const sound = new Sound({
    src: "https://YOUR_SOUND_URL.mp3",
    volume: 0.5, // 0.0 to 1.0
    loop: true, // loop the sound
    sync: false, // do not wait for the sound to finish
});
```

## Play Sound

You can play the sound by adding it to the scene.

```typescript
scene1.action([
    sound.play(), // If the sound is sync, the scene will wait for the sound to finish
]);
```

## Sound Actions

You can pause/resume/fade/stop/setVolume/setRate the sound.

```typescript
scene1.action([
    sound.pause(),
    character1.say`The sound is paused`,
    sound.resume(),
    character1.say`The sound is resumed`,
]);
```

For more information about the Sound, please read the [Sound](../core/elements/sound) documentation.

## Background Music

You can add the music to the scene, the scene will automatically play the music when it starts.

```typescript
const scene = new Scene("scene 1", {
    backgroundMusic: YOUR_SOUND_INSTANCE,
    backgroundMusicFade: 1000, // if specified, when the scene changes, the music will fade in/out in 1000ms
});
```

## Sound Effects

You can easily create a sound effect with these configurations.

```typescript
const soundEffect = new Sound({
    src: "https://YOUR_SOUND_URL.mp3",
    sync: false,
});

scene1.action([
    soundEffect.play(),
]);
```

When the sound effect is played, it will not wait for the sound to finish.
