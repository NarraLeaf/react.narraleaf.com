# ITransition

Transition effect is used to animate the Image or Scene when changing image or background of the scene.

```ts
interface ITransition<T extends ElementProp = {}> {
    events: EventDispatcher<EventTypes<[T[]]>>;
    controller: AnimationPlaybackControls | null | undefined;
    start(onComplete?: () => void): void;
    toElementProps(): T[];
    setSrc(src: string): void;
    copy(): ITransition<T>;
}
```

## Public Method

### start

Start the transition effect.

- `onComplete?: () => void` - Callback function that will be called when the transition is completed.

> You can request animation by calling `Base.prototype.requestAnimation` if you extend the `Base` class.
> 
> ```ts
> super.requestAnimation({
>     start: 0,
>     end: 1,
>     duration: this.duration
> }, {
>     onComplete,
>     onUpdate: (value) => {
>         this.state.opacity = value;
>     }
> });
> ```


### setSrc

Set the source of the image element.  
Some transition won't get the src immediately when instantiated. 
Instead, when it is using in the scene, the src will be set by scene. 
So we need to provide a method to set the src.

### toElementProps

Returns an array of ElementProps, each element represents the properties of the image element.  

Here is an example of [Dissolve.ts](https://github.com/NarraLeaf/narraleaf-react/blob/master/src/game/nlcore/elements/transition/dissolve.ts): 

```ts
public toElementProps(): (DissolveProps & ElementProp)[] {
    return [
        { // for the first image
            style: {opacity: this.state.opacity},
        },
        { // for the second image
            style: {opacity: 1 - this.state.opacity},
            src: this.src,
        }
    ];
}
```

When we dissolve the image, we actually render two images at the same time. The first image has an opacity of `this.state.opacity`, and the second image has an opacity of `1 - this.state.opacity`.  
So that the first image will gradually disappear, and the second image will gradually appear.

### copy

Returns a new instance of the transition effect.

## Public Property

### events

You don't need to override this property.

### controller

You don't need to override this property.

## Custom Transition

You can create your own transition effect by implementing the [ITransition](https://github.com/NarraLeaf/narraleaf-react/blob/master/src/game/nlcore/elements/transition/type.ts) interface and extends the [Base](https://github.com/NarraLeaf/narraleaf-react/blob/master/src/game/nlcore/elements/transition/base.ts) class.

Here is an example of [Dissolve.ts](https://github.com/NarraLeaf/narraleaf-react/blob/master/src/game/nlcore/elements/transition/dissolve.ts):

```ts
import {Base, ITransition} from 'narraleaf-react';

type DissolveProps = {
    style: {
        opacity: number;
    },
    src?: string;
};

/**
 * @class Dissolve
 * @implements ITransition
 * @extends Base
 * @description Dissolve transition effect
 */
export class Dissolve extends Base<DissolveProps> implements ITransition<DissolveProps> {
    private duration: number;
    private opacity = 0;
    private src: string | undefined;

    /**
     * Image will dissolve from one image to another
     */
    constructor(duration: number = 1000, src?: string) {
        super();
        this.duration = duration;
        if (src) {
            this.src = src;
        }
    }

    setSrc(src: string) {
        this.src = src;
    }

    public start(onComplete?: () => void): void {
        this.state.opacity = 1;

        this.requestAnimation({
            start: 1,
            end: 0,
            duration: this.duration
        }, {
            onComplete,
            onUpdate: (value) => {
                this.opacity = value;
            }
        });
    }

    public toElementProps() {
        return [
            {
                style: {opacity: this.opacity},
            },
            {
                style: {opacity: 1 - this.opacity},
                src: this.src,
            }
        ];
    }

    copy(): ITransition<DissolveProps> {
        return new Dissolve(this.duration, this.src);
    }
}
```
