# GameHistoryAction

```typescript
type GameHistoryAction = {
    token: string;
    action: Action;
    isPending?: boolean;
};
```

The `GameHistoryAction` type represents a single action in the game history. It contains:
- `token`: A unique identifier for the action
- `action`: The actual action that was performed
- `isPending`: Whether the action is pending. For example, the action is pending if the menu pop up but the user hasn't made a choice yet.
