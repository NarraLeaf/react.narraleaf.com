export type ActionStatements = ChainedActions | string[];
```

## Example

scene.action([
    character`Hello, world!`, // This is a valid action statement

    character
        .char(/* ... */)
        .transform(/* ... */)
        .say`Hello, world!`, // This is also a valid chained action statement

    Menu
        .prompt(/* ... */)
        .choose("This is option 1", [
            character`You chose option 1`, // Statement can be nested
        ]),

    // This is equivalent to (new Character(null)).say`I am a sentence said by a narrator`
    "I am a sentence said by a narrator",
    "Once upon a time, there was a girl named Alice.",
    "She was a girl who loved to read books.",
