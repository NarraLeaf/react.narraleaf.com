   - `text`: The spoken text
   - `voice`: The voice src URL or null if no voice was used
   - `character`: The character name or null if the sentence is not spoken by a character

2. A "menu" element:
   - `text`: The menu text
   - `selected`: The selected option or null if the menu is still pending
