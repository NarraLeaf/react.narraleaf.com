# GameHistory

```typescript
export type GameHistory = GameHistoryAction & {
    element: GameElementHistory;
};
```

The `GameHistory` type represents a complete game history entry, combining both the action information and the specific game element that was affected. It extends `GameHistoryAction` and adds:

- `element`: The specific game element (either a "say" or "menu" element) that was part of this history entry
