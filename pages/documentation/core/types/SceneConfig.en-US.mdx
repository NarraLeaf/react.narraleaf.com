type SceneConfig = {
    invertY: boolean;
    invertX: boolean;

If `true`, the X-axis will be inverted.

In the default coordinate system, the origin is at the top-left corner of the screen, with the X-axis pointing to the right. If you set this property to true, the X-axis will point to the left.
