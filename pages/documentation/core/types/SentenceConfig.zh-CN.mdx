# SentenceConfig

```ts
type SentenceConfig = {
    pause?: boolean | number;
    voice: Sound | null;
    character: Character | null;
    voiceId: string | number | null;
} & Color & Font;
```

For Color, see [color](./color#Color).
For Font, see [Font](./Font).

## voice

The voice that will say the sentence.

If you specify the voice, the voiceId will be ignored.

```ts
character1.say("hello!", {
    voice: new Sound({
        src: "/your/path/to/voice.mp3"
    })
});
```

## voiceId

VoiceId is a unique identifier for the voice. It can be a string or a number.

For example, if you have a lot of voice files, you can use the voiceId to identify the voice.

```ts
const voiceScene = new Scene("voice-scene", {
    voices: {
        "a_1_1": "/your/path/to/voice.mp3"
    }
});

voiceScene.action([
    character1
        .say("hello!", {
            voiceId: "a_1_1"
        }),
]);
```

Or you can use a handler to generate the voiceId.

```ts
const voiceScene = new Scene("voice-scene", {
    voices: (id) => `/static/game/sound/bgm/${id}.mp3`
});
```

## character

The character that will say the sentence. Using this property will override the previous character.
