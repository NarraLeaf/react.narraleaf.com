# Scene

Scene contains multiple actions that can be performed on the scene. 

For example, you can add a [Character](./character) Action to the scene

```ts
import { Scene } from 'narraleaf-react';

const scene = new Scene("scene 1");
const character1 = new Character("character 1");

scene.action([
    character1
        .say("Hello World")
        .say("How are you?"),
]);
```

## Public Method

### constructor

<Steps>

- `name: string` - Name of the scene
- `config?: DeepPartial<SceneConfig>` - [SceneConfig](../types/SceneConfig)

</Steps>

### action

<Steps>

Add actions to the scene. Do not call this method more than once.

#### Overload 1 of 2

- `actions: (ChainableAction | ChainableAction[])[]` - Actions to be executed, see [ChainedActions](../types/ChainedActions)

#### Overload 2 of 2

This overload let you pass a function that receives the scene instance and returns the actions to be executed.

In some cases, you may want to make a shortcut to the scene instance

```ts
story.entry(
    new Scene("scene 1").action(scene => [
        scene
            .setBackground(background)
            .sleep(1000),
    ])
);
```

- `actions: ((scene: Scene) => ChainedAction[])` - Actions to be executed, see [ChainedActions](../types/ChainedActions)

</Steps>

### inherit

<Steps>

Inherit the configuration from another scene. Current scene's configuration will override the inherited configuration.

- `scene: Scene` - The Scene instance to inherit from
- Returns `this`

</Steps>

- `transition?: ITransition` - [Transition](../types/ITransition)

</Steps>

### applyTransform

<Steps>

Apply a transform to the background. Usually used for shaking or zooming effect.

- `transform: Transform<TransformDefinitions.ImageTransformProps>` - [Transform](../animation/transform)\<[TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[ImageTransformProps](../types/TransformDefinitions#ImageTransformProps)\>

</Steps>

### jumpTo

<Steps>

Jump to another scene. If the transition is provided, the scene will be changed with the transition effect.

> Note: The current scene will be disposed after jumping to another scene. The rest of the actions will not be executed.

- `scene: Scene | string` - The Scene instance or the name of the scene to jump to
- `config: Partial<JumpConfig>` - [Jump Config](../types/JumpConfig)

</Steps>

### sleep

<Steps>

Sleep for a duration before executing the next action.

#### Overload 1 of 3

- `ms: number` - Duration in milliseconds

#### Overload 2 of 3

- `promise: Promise<any>` - Promise to wait for

#### Overload 3 of 3

- `awaitable: Awaitable<any, any>` - unresolved [Awaitable](../types/Awaitable)

</Steps>

### setBackgroundMusic

<Steps>

Set background music of the scene.
