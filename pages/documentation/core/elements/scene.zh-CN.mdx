> This class extends [Displayble](./displayable)

Scene contains multiple actions that can be performed on the scene. 

For example, you can add a [Character](./character) Action to the scene

```ts
import { Scene } from 'narraleaf-react';

const scene = new Scene("scene 1");
const character1 = new Character("character 1");

scene.action([
    character1
        .say("Hello World")
        .say("How are you?"),
]);
```

## Public Properties

### local

<Steps>

`scene.local` is a [Persistent](./persistent) instance that is local to the scene.
It is used to store the temporary data that is only available in the scene.

Local data doesn't need to be registered or initialised, but it is 'undefined' before it is used.

> Data in local will be discarded when the scene is exited.

```ts
scene.action([
    new Menu("Which coffee do you want?")
        .choose("Latte", [
            scene.local.set("coffee", "latte"),
        ])
        .choose("Cappuccino", [
            scene.local.set("coffee", "cappuccino"),
        ]),
    character1.say`You chose ${scene.local.get("coffee")} coffee`,
]);
```

</Steps>

### background

<Steps>

This property is used to access the background [Image](./image) instance of the scene.

```ts
scene.background
    .char("background.png", new Dissolve(1000, "linear"))
```

</Steps>

### backgroundLayer

<Steps>

This property is used to access the background layer of the scene.  
This layer contains the background image of the scene.

```ts
scene.backgroundLayer.opacity(0.5, 1000, "linear")
```

</Steps>

### displayableLayer

<Steps>

This property is used to access the displayable layer of the scene.  
This layer contains all the displayables that don't belong to any specific layer.

```ts
scene.displayableLayer.opacity(0.5, 1000, "linear")
```

</Steps>

## Public Method

### constructor

<Steps>

- `name: string` - Name of the scene
- `config?: Partial<ISceneUserConfig>` - [ISceneUserConfig](../types/IsceneUserConfig)

</Steps>

### action

<Steps>

Add actions to the scene. Do not call this method more than once.

#### Overload 1 of 2

- `actions: (ChainableAction | ChainableAction[])[]` - Actions to be executed, see [ChainedActions](../types/ChainedActions)

#### Overload 2 of 2

This overload let you pass a function that receives the scene instance and returns the actions to be executed.

In some cases, you may want to make a shortcut to the scene instance

```ts
story.entry(
    new Scene("scene 1").action(scene => [
        scene
            .setBackground(background)
            .sleep(1000),
    ])
);
```

- `actions: ((scene: Scene) => ChainedAction[])` - Actions to be executed, see [ChainedActions](../types/ChainedActions)
- Returns `this`

</Steps>

### preloadImage

<Steps>

Manually register image sources

- `src: string | string[]` - The URL of the image or an array of URLs
- Returns `this`

</Steps>


## Chainable Method

### setBackground

<Steps>

Alias of `scene.background.char`.

Set background of the scene. If the transition is provided, the background will be changed with the transition effect.

```typescript
scene.action([
    scene.setBackground("background.png")

    // is equivalent to
    scene.background.char("background.png")
]);
```

- `background: Color | ImageSrc` - See [Color](../types/color) or [ImageSrc](../types/imageSrc)
- `transition?: ImageTransition` - For ImageTransition, see [Transition](../animation/transition)

</Steps>

### jumpTo

<Steps>

Jump to another scene. If the transition is provided, the scene will be changed with the transition effect.

> Note: The current scene will be disposed after jumping to another scene. The rest of the actions will not be executed.

- `scene: Scene | string` - The Scene instance or the name of the scene to jump to
- `config: Partial<JumpConfig>` - [Jump Config](../types/JumpConfig)

</Steps>

### sleep

<Steps>

Sleep for a duration before executing the next action.

```typescript
scene.action([
    scene.sleep(1000)
]);
```

#### Overload 1 of 2

- `ms: number` - Duration in milliseconds

#### Overload 2 of 2

- `promise: Promise<any>` - Promise to wait for

</Steps>

### setBackgroundMusic

<Steps>

Set background music of the scene.

- `sound: Sound` - [Sound](./sound) instance
- `fade?: number` - If set, the fade-out effect will be applied to the previous music, and the fade-in effect will be applied to the current music, with a duration in milliseconds

</Steps>
