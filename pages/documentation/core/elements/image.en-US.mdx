Image is very important for a visual novel. It is used to show the appearance of the character. 

In NarraLeaf-React, Image only controls the appearance of the character. It does not control the dialogues of the character. For that, you can use [Character](../character).

## Public Method

### constructor

- `name: string` - The name of the image, it will be used for debugging purpose
- `config?: DeepPartial<ImageConfig>` - [ImageConfig](../types/ImageConfig)

### dispose

Generally, **you do not need to call this method**. This method is used to dispose the image.  
Disposed image will not be shown in the screen for the rest of the story.

### setSrc

- `src: string | StaticImageData` - The source of the image
- `transition?: ITransition` - For ITransition, see [ITransition](../types/ITransition)

```typescript
image.setSrc("your/image/src", new Fade(1000));
```
