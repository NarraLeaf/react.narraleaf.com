# Scene

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    This page is under construction.
</Callout>

Scene contains multiple actions that can be performed on the scene. 

For example, you can add a [Character](./character) Action to the scene

```ts
import { Scene } from 'narraleaf-react';

const scene = new Scene("scene 1");
const character1 = new Character("character 1");

scene.action([
    character1
        .say("Hello World")
        .say("How are you?")
        .toActions(),
]);
```

## Public Method

### constructor

- `name: string` - Name of the scene
- `config?: DeepPartial<SceneConfig>` - [SceneConfig](../types/SceneConfig)

### setBackground

Set background of the scene. If the transition is provided, the background will be changed with the transition effect.

- `background: Background` - [Background](../types/Background)
- `transition?: ITransition` - [Transition](../types/ITransition)

### applyTransform

Apply a transform to the background. Usually used for shaking or zooming effect.

- `transform: Transform<ImageTransformProps>` - [Transform](../animation/transform)\<TransformDefinitions.[ImageTransformProps](../types/ImageTransformProps)\>

### jumpTo

Jump to another scene. If the transition is provided, the scene will be changed with the transition effect.

> Note: The current scene will be disposed after jumping to another scene. The rest of the actions will not be executed.

- `arg0: Scene` - The Scene instance you want to jump to
- `config: Partial<JumpConfig>` - [Jump Config](../types/JumpConfig)

### sleep

Sleep for a duration before executing the next action.

#### Overload 1 of 3

- `ms: number` - Duration in milliseconds

#### Overload 2 of 3

- `promise: Promise<any>` - Promise to wait for

#### Overload 3 of 3

- `awaitable: Awaitable<any, any>` - unresolved [Awaitable](../types/Awaitable)

### setBackgroundMusic

Set background music of the scene.

- `sound: Sound` - [Sound](./sound) instance
- `fade?: number` - If set, the fade-out effect will be applied to the previous music, and the fade-in effect will be applied to the current music, with a duration in milliseconds

### action

Add actions to the scene. Do not call this method more than once.

#### Overload 1 of 2

- `actions: (Actions | Actions[])[]` - Actions to be executed

#### Overload 2 of 2

This overload let you pass a function that receives the scene instance and returns the actions to be executed.

In some cases, you may want to make a shortcut to the scene instance

```ts
story.entry(
    new Scene("scene 1").action(scene => [
        scene
            .setBackground(background)
            .sleep(1000)
            .toActions(),
    ])
);
```

- `actions: ((scene: Scene) => Actions[])` - Actions to be executed

### toActions

Convert the actions to an array of actions.
