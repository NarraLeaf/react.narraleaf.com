Image is very important for a visual novel. It is used to show the appearance of the character. 

In NarraLeaf-React, Image only controls the appearance of the character. It does not control the dialogues of the character. For that, you can use [Character](../character).

## Public Method

### constructor

<Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    You cannot mix tag-based image and src-based image in the same image.
</Callout>

- `config: Partial<RichImageUserConfig<T>>` -Image config - [RichImageUserConfig](../types/RichImageUserConfig#RichImageUserConfig)

#### Tag-based Image

For example, if you have an image that has tags like `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, you can use tag-based image.

Here is an example of tag-based image.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    tag: {
        groups: [
            ["happy", "sad", "angry"],
            ["shirt", "jacket", "t-shirt"],
            ["trousers", "skirt", "shorts"],
        ],
        defaults: ["happy", "shirt", "trousers"],
    } as const,
    src: (emotion, top, bottom) => `https://your/image/src/${emotion}_${top}_${bottom}.png`,
});
// The default image will be `https://your/image/src/happy_shirt_trousers.png`
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

**Note:** You cannot have two identical tags in the same group or in different groups.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    tag: {
        groups: [
            ["a", "b", "c"],
            ["1", "2", "3"],
            ["a"], // INVALID, tag "a" is already in the first group
            ["x", "y", "y"], // INVALID, tag "y" is duplicated
        ],
        defaults: ["a"], // INVALID, default definition must have a full set of tags
    } as const,
    /* ... */
});
```
</Callout>

#### Src-based Image

If you don't have tags, you can use src-based image.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    src: "https://your/image/src.png",
});
```

#### Wearable Image

You can add some wearables to the image.

```typescript
const image = new Image("image-name", {
    /* ... */
    wearables: [new Image(/* ... */)],
});
```

</Steps>

### copy

<Steps>

Copy the image.

- Returns `Image`

```typescript
const newImage = image.copy();
```

</Steps>

## Chainable Method

### dispose

<Steps>

Generally, **you do not need to call this method**. This method is used to dispose the image.  
Disposed image will not be shown in the screen for the rest of the story.

</Steps>

### setSrc

<Steps>

- `src: string | StaticImageData` - The source of the image
- `transition?: ITransition` - For ITransition, see [ITransition](../types/ITransition)

```typescript
image.setSrc("your/image/src", new Fade(1000));
```

</Steps>

### setAppearance

<Steps>

Set the appearance of the image.

> **Note:** Use a full set of tags if possible, this will help the lib to predict the next appearance.

- `tags: TagGroupDefinition ? FlexibleTuple<SelectElementFromEach<Tags>> : string[]` - Tags of the image
- `transition?: IImageTransition` - For IImageTransition, see [IImageTransition](../types/IImageTransition)

```typescript
// happy, shirt, trousers
const image = new Image({
    tag: {
        groups: [
            ["happy", "sad", "angry"],
            ["shirt", "jacket", "t-shirt"],
            ["trousers", "skirt", "shorts"],
        ],
        defaults: ["happy", "shirt", "trousers"],
    } as const,
    /* ... */
});

//  happy , [jacket], [t-shirt]
image.setAppearance(["jacket", "t-shirt"], new Fade(1000));

// [angry],  jacket ,  t-shirt
image.setAppearance(["angry"], new Fade(1000));
```

</Steps>

### applyTransform

<Steps>

- `transform: Transform` - [Transform](../animation/transform)

</Steps>

### show

<Steps>

Show the image.

#### Overload 1 of 3

Show image immediately.

```typescript
image.show();
```

#### Overload 2 of 3

Show image with custom transform.

> **Note:** You have to add `alpha: 1` in the transform props to show the image.

- `options: Transform` - [Transform](../animation/transform)

#### Overload 3 of 3

Show image with transform config. A transform with alpha:1 will be applied to the image.

- `options: Partial<TransformDefinitions.CommonTransformProps>` - See TransformDefinitions.[CommonTransformProps](../types/CommonTransformProps)

```typescript
image.show({
    duration: 1000,
    ease: "easeInOut",
});
```

</Steps>

### hide

<Steps>

Hide the image.

#### Overload 1 of 3

Hide image immediately.

```typescript
image.hide();
```

#### Overload 2 of 3

Hide image with custom transform.

> **Note:** You have to add `alpha: 0` in the transform props to hide the image.

- `options: Transform` - [Transform](../animation/transform)

#### Overload 3 of 3

Hide image with transform config. A transform with alpha:0 will be applied to the image.

- `options: Partial<TransformDefinitions.CommonTransformProps>` - See TransformDefinitions.[CommonTransformProps](../types/CommonTransformProps)

```typescript
image.hide({
    duration: 1000,
    ease: "easeInOut",
});
```

</Steps>

### addWearable

<Steps>

Add a wearable to the image

> Wearable is a feature that allows you to add an image that related to the main image. For example, you can add a hat to the character.
> And that wearable image will move/scale/animate with the main image.

- `children: Image | Image[]` - Wearable image or images
- Returns `this`

```typescript
const childImage = new Image(/* ... */);

image.addWearable(childImage);
```

</Steps>

### bindWearable

<Steps>

Bind this image to a parent image as a wearable

- `parent: Image` - Parent image
- Returns `this`

```typescript
childImage.bindWearable(parentImage);
```

</Steps>
