Image is very important for a visual novel. It is used to show the appearance of the character. 

In NarraLeaf-React, Image only controls the appearance of the character. It does not control the dialogues of the character. For that, you can use [Character](../character).

## Public Method

### constructor

<Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    You cannot mix tag-based image and src-based image in the same image.
</Callout>

- `config: Partial<IImageUserConfig>` - Image config, see [IImageUserConfig](../types/IImageUserConfig)

#### Tag-based Image

For example, if you have an image that has tags like `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, you can use tag-based image.

Here is an example of tag-based image.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    src: {
        groups: [
            ["happy", "sad", "angry"],
            ["shirt", "jacket", "t-shirt"],
            ["trousers", "skirt", "shorts"],
        ],
        defaults: ["happy", "shirt", "trousers"],
        resolve: (emotion, top, bottom) => `https://your/image/src/${emotion}_${top}_${bottom}.png`
    } as const,
});
// The default image will be `https://your/image/src/happy_shirt_trousers.png`
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

**Note:** You cannot have two identical tags in the same group or in different groups.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    src: {
        groups: [
            ["a", "b", "c"],
            ["1", "2", "3"],
            ["a"], // INVALID, tag "a" is already in the first group
            ["x", "y", "y"], // INVALID, tag "y" is duplicated
        ],
        defaults: ["a"], // INVALID, default definition must have a full set of tags
    } as const,
    /* ... */
});
```
</Callout>

#### Src-based Image

If you don't have tags, you can use src-based image.

```typescript
const image = new Image({
    src: "https://your/image/src.png",
});
```

#### Wearable Image

You can add some wearables to the image.  
The wearable image will move/scale/animate with the main image.

```typescript
const child = new Image({
    /* ... */
});
const parent = new Image({
    /* ... */
}).wear(child);
```

> **Note:** The image can only have one parent.

</Steps>

### copy

<Steps>

Copy the image.

- Returns `Image`

```typescript
const newImage = image.copy();
```

</Steps>

### useLayer

<Steps>

Use a layer for the image

- `layer: Layer` - [Layer](./layer)

```typescript
const layer = new Layer(/* ... */);

image.useLayer(layer);
```

</Steps>

## Chainable Method

### char

<Steps>

Set the figure of the character

- `src: ImageSrc | Color | SelectElementFromEach<Tags> | FlexibleTuple<SelectElementFromEach<Tags>>` - The source of the image
- `transition?: ImageTransition` - For ImageTransition, see [Transition](../animation/transition)

```typescript
image.char("your/image/src", new Fade(1000));
```

or for tag-based image

```typescript
// happy, shirt, trousers
const image = new Image({
    tag: {
        groups: [
            ["happy", "sad", "angry"],
            ["shirt", "jacket", "t-shirt"],
            ["trousers", "skirt", "shorts"],
        ],
        defaults: ["happy", "shirt", "trousers"],
    } as const,
    /* ... */
});

//  happy , [jacket], [t-shirt]
image.setAppearance(["jacket", "t-shirt"], new Fade(1000));

// [angry],  jacket ,  t-shirt
image.setAppearance(["angry"], new Fade(1000));
```

</Steps>

### addWearable

<Steps>

Add a wearable to the image

> Wearable is a feature that allows you to add an image that related to the main image. For example, you can add a hat to the character.
> And that wearable image will move/scale/animate with the main image.

- `children: Image | Image[]` - Wearable image or images
- Returns `this`

```typescript
const childImage = new Image(/* ... */);

image.addWearable(childImage);
```

</Steps>

### wear

<Steps>

Alias of `addWearable`

</Steps>

### bindWearable

<Steps>

Bind this image to a parent image as a wearable

- `parent: Image` - Parent image
- Returns `this`

```typescript
childImage.bindWearable(parentImage);
```

</Steps>

### asWearableOf

<Steps>

Alias of `bindWearable`

</Steps>
