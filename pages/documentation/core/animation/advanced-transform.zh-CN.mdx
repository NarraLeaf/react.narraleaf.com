We are going to explain the advanced usage of the Transform class.

Transform takes a series of sequences to create a complex transformation. Each sequence will be executed one by one.  

## Sequence

A single sequence is made of `props` and `options`.

### Props

Props is an object that contains the properties of the transformation.

#### Sync

If `sync` for the single sequence is set to `false`, the next sequence will not wait for the current sequence to finish.  
If `sync` for the whole transform is set to `false`, the sequences will be executed one by one, but the process will not wait for these sequences to finish.
