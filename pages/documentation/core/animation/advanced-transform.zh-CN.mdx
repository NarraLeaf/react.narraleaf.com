We are going to explain the advanced usage of the Transform class.

Transform takes a series of sequences to create a complex transformation. Each sequence will be executed one by one.  

## Sequence

A single sequence is made of `props` and `options`.

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[Sequence](../types/TransformDefinitions#Sequence)

Here is an example of a sequence:

```typescript
{
    props: {
        // The character will move to the left and scale down at the same time
        position: CommonPosition.Positions.Left,
        scale: 0.3
    },
    options: {
        // The transformation will take 1000ms
        duration: 1000,

        // The easing function is easeOut
        ease: "easeOut"
    }
}
```

### Props

Props is an object that contains the properties of the transformation.

For image transformation, see [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[ImageTransformProps](../types/TransformDefinitions#ImageTransformProps).

### Options

Options is an object that contains the options of the transformation.

For more information, see [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[CommonTransformProps](../types/TransformDefinitions#CommonTransformProps).

#### `sync`

If `sync` for the single sequence is set to `false`, the next sequence will not wait for the current sequence to finish.  

#### `duration`

The duration of the transformation in milliseconds.

#### `delay`

#### `ease`

Definition for easing function, or a built-in easing function name.

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[EasingDefinition](../types/TransformDefinitions#EasingDefinition)

## Transform Config

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[TransformConfig](../types/TransformDefinitions#TransformConfig)

#### `sync`

If `sync` for the whole transform is set to `false`, the sequences will be executed one by one, but the process will not wait for these sequences to finish.

It is as same as the [Control.doAsync](../elements/control#doasync)

## How does it work?

NarraLeaf-React use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/) to animate the elements. It follows the steps below:

1. for each sequence
    1. merge the previous props with the current props
    2. convert the props to the style object
    3. use `useAnimate` to animate the container of the element
    4. if the sequence is not `sync`, go to the next sequence, otherwise wait for the current sequence to finish
2. if the whole transform is not `sync`, the process will not wait for the sequences to finish
