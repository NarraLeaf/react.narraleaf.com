In NarraLeaf-React, transitions can be used on elements and scene background. For example, you can use image transitions to transition images. 

```typescript
image.setSrc("image1.png", new Dissolve(3000))
```

Here is a list of transition types:
1. [ImageTransition](./transitions/IImageTransition)
2. [TextTransition](./transitions/ITextTransition)

You can only apply specific transitions to specific elements. For example, you can only apply `IImageTransition` to `Image` elements

There are some built-in transitions in NarraLeaf-React. If you want to custom your own transition, please see [Advanced Transition](./advanced-transition).

## Built-in Image Transitions

### Dissolve

The current image will fade out, and the next image will fade in at the same time

```typescript
constructor(duration?: number, easing?: TransformDefinitions.EasingDefinition);
```

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[EasingDefinition](../types/TransformDefinitions#EasingDefinition)

### Fade

The current image will fade out, and the next image will fade in

```typescript
constructor(duration?: number, ease?: TransformDefinitions.EasingDefinition);
```

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[EasingDefinition](../types/TransformDefinitions#EasingDefinition)

### FadeIn

The next image will fade-in in a direction

```typescript
/**
 * @param direction The direction the image will move from
 * @param offset The distance the image will move (in pixels)
 * @param duration The duration of the transition
 * @param easing The easing function
 */
constructor(direction: "left" | "right" | "top" | "bottom", offset: number, duration?: number, easing?: TransformDefinitions.EasingDefinition);
```

See [TransformDefinitions](../types/TransformDefinitions).[EasingDefinition](../types/TransformDefinitions#EasingDefinition)
