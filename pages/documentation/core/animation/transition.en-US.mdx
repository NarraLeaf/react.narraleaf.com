In NarraLeaf-React, transitions can be used on elements and scene background. For example, you can use transitions to transition images. 

```typescript
image.setSrc("image1.png", new Dissolve(3000))
```

There are some built-in transitions in NarraLeaf-React. If you want to custom your own transition, please see [Advanced Transition](./advanced-transition).

## Built-in Transitions

### Dissolve

The current image will fade out, and the next image will fade in at the same time

```typescript
constructor(duration?: number, src?: string | NextJSStaticImageData | Scene);
```

### Fade

The current image will fade out, and the next image will fade in

```typescript
constructor(duration?: number, src?: Scene | StaticImageData | string);
```

### FadeIn

The next image will fade-in in a direction

```typescript
/**
 * @param direction The direction the image will move from
 * @param offset The distance the image will move (in pixels)
 * @param duration The duration of the transition
 * @param src The source of the next image
 */
constructor(direction: "left" | "right" | "top" | "bottom", offset: number, duration?: number, src?: Scene | StaticImageData | string);
```
