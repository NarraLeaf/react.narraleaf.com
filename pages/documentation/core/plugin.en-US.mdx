The plugin system is a crucial component for a framework designed to be highly extensible. Plugins provide the capability to inject, modify, or monitor game logic, enabling developers to extend the framework's functionality according to their specific needs.

Additionally, the plugin system facilitates code reuse by allowing developers to leverage community-developed tools or create custom scripts that can be shared and integrated across different projects.

## Defining a Plugin

In NarraLeaf-React, a plugin is defined as an object that implements the `IGamePluginRegistry` interface.

```typescript
interface IGamePluginRegistry {
    name: string;
    register(game: Game): void;
    unregister(game: Game): void;
}
```

- The `name` property uniquely identifies the plugin.
- The `register` method is invoked during game initialization.
- The `unregister` method is called when the game is destroyed, providing an opportunity to clean up any side effects.

Here's an example of a plugin that listens to the `init` event:

```typescript
import { Game, IGamePluginRegistry, LiveGameEventToken } from "narraleaf-react";

let listenerToken: LiveGameEventToken;

const plugin: IGamePluginRegistry = {
    name: "test_plugin",

    register: (game: Game) => {
        // This logic executes once the game is initialized
        // and before the player component is rendered
        listenerToken = game.hooks.hook("init", () => {
            console.log("Game initialized");
        });
    },

    unregister: (game: Game) => {
        // This logic executes when the game is disposed
        // and before the player component is unmounted
        listenerToken.cancel();
    }
};
```

For detailed information about hooks, please refer to the [Hooks](./game/hooks.en-US.mdx) documentation.

## Registering a Plugin

To register a plugin, you need to pass the plugin registry to the `Game` instance. Here's how to do it:

```typescript
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { Game, useGame } from "narraleaf-react";

function App() {
    // Call this hook inside your component
    const game = useGame();

    useEffect(() => {
        game.use(YOUR_PLUGIN_REGISTRY);
    }, [game]);

    return /* ... */;
}
```
