## FAQ

### Is the game singleton?

Yes, the game is a singleton. You can access it inside any react component.

```typescript
const game = useGame();
```

### How to save the game?

NarraLeaf-React does not provide a save/load system. It only has methods to serialize and deserialize the game state.

However, we are working on a complete desktop solution to manage the clutter. Ex. Save/Load, UI, packaging, etc.

For a complete VN engine, please check [NarraLeaf](https://github.com/NarraLeaf/NarraLeaf).

### How to customize the UI?

You can customize the UI by using slot components.

For more information, please refer to the [Player](./player) page.
