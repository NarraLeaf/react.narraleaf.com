If you are coming from Ren'Py, you might need to know these things:

- **Character** in NarraLeaf only controls the dialogues of the character. It does not control the appearance of the character or image. For that, you can use [Image](../image).
- **Scene** in NarraLeaf = **Label** in Ren'Py. NarraLeaf do not have a class that is similar to Ren'Py's **Scene**.
- **Transition** and **Transform** can use on both Scene and Image

**Note:** NarraLeaf focuses on the playing of the story. It does not have a feature to control GUI, and it is not an complete engine like Ren'Py.
