# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the **NarraLeaf-React** library!

NarraLeaf-React is a lightweight, customizable, and easy-to-use Visual Novel framework for React. It is designed to help you create your own Visual Novel with React.

## Why NarraLeaf-React?

- **Lightweight**: No rendering libraries, no unnecessary dependencies
- **Customizable**: Custom everything for your app, no need to learn a new language
- **Built for Developers**: Based on OOP principles, easy to extend and maintain

NarraLeaf-React replaces traditional engines that require a new scripting language with a more flexible solution. Using **React** and **TypeScript**, you can fully customize your Visual Novel’s UI, making it as unique as you want—no need for complex scripting.
