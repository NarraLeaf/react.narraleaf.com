Player is a part of the NarraLeaf-React framework that includes some react components to play the story.

If you are creating a story using abstract classes, please check the [Core](/documentation/core) documentation.

If you are looking for the `Player` component, you can find it [here](/documentation/player/player).

## Quick Start

If you did not have a story yet, you can create a story using the `Story` class and export it.
Please read the [Core](/documentation/core) documentation to learn how to create a story.

This is a basic example of how to use the `Player` component:

```tsx
"use client";

import { GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { story } from "./my-story";

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <GameProviders>
            <Player story={story} onReady={({ liveGame }) => {
                liveGame.newGame();
            }}
                width="100vw"
                height="100vh"
            />
        </GameProviders>
    );
}
```

Let us explain the code above:

### 1. import the necessary components from the NarraLeaf-React library.

```tsx
import { GameProviders, Player } from "narraleaf-react";
```

These components are required to create a game.
`GameProviders` is a context provider that provides the game instance to the components. `Player` is the component
that plays the story.

### 2. render `GameProviders` and `Player` components.

```tsx
<GameProviders>
    <Player story={story} onReady={({ liveGame }) => {
        liveGame.newGame();
    }}
        width="100vw"
        height="100vh"
    >
    </Player>
</GameProviders>
```

You have to wrap the `Player` component with the `GameProviders` component.
The `Player` component takes the `story` prop, which is the story you want to play.
The `onReady` prop is a callback function that is called when the game is ready to start.
You can start the game by calling the `newGame` method of the `liveGame` object.

`width` and `height` are the width and height of the `Player` component. The player will scale to fit the given width and height.
